# Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

* On-premises versus cloud comparison:
  * Traditional Infrastructure
    * Equipment
    * Resources and administration
    * Cost
    * Contracts
    * Scale up and down
  * AWS Cloud
    * No upfront expenseâ€”pay for what you use
    * Improve time to market and agility
    * Self-service infrastructure

* What is Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)?
  * "Financial estimate to help identify direct and indirect costs of a system"
  * Why use TCO?
    * To compare costs of running infrastructure on-premises versus on AWS
    * To budget and build business case for moving to cloud

* TCO considerations include:
  * Server Costs
    * Hardware: Server, rack chassis, PDUs, TOR switches (and maintenance)
    * Software: OS, virtualization licenses (and maintenance)
    * Server administration costs
    * Facilities cost: Space, Power, Cooling
  * Storage Costs
    * Hardware: Storage disks, SAN or FC switches
    * Storage administration costs
    * Facilities cost: Space, Power, Cooling
  * Network Costs
    * Network hardware: LAN switches, load balancer bandwidth costs
    * Network administration costs
    * Facilities cost: Space, Power, Cooling
  * IT Labor Costs

* On-premises versus all-in-cloud example:
  * Sample comparison shows 96% savings by moving to AWS
  * 3-year total savings: $159,913
  * On-premises solution continues to incur costs whether capacity is used
  * AWS solution commissioned when needed and decommissioned when resources no longer in use

* AWS Pricing Calculator
  * Estimate monthly costs
  * Identify opportunities to reduce monthly costs
  * Model solutions before building them
  * Explore price points and calculations behind estimate
  * Find available instance types and contract terms that meet needs
  * Create and name groups of services for organization

* Reading an estimate:
  * First 12 months total - combined upfront and monthly estimates
  * Total upfront - pay as you set up AWS stack
  * Total monthly - spend every month while running AWS stack
  * Within groups, see service-specific costs

* Additional benefit considerations:
  * Hard benefits
    * Reduced spending on compute, storage, networking, security
    * Reductions in hardware and software purchases (capex)
    * Reductions in operational costs, backup, disaster recovery
    * Reduction in operations personnel
  * Soft Benefits
    * Reuse of services and applications
    * Increased developer productivity
    * Improved customer satisfaction
    * Agile business processes that quickly respond to opportunities
    * Increase in global reach

* Delaware North case study:
  * Background:
    * Growing global company with 200+ locations
    * 500 million customers, $3 billion annual revenue
  * Challenge:
    * Meet demand to rapidly deploy new solutions
    * Constantly upgrade aging equipment
  * Criteria:
    * Broad solution to handle all workloads
    * Ability to modify processes to improve efficiency and lower costs
    * Eliminate busy work (such as patching software)
    * Achieve positive ROI
  * Solution:
    * Moved on-premises data center to AWS
    * Eliminated 205 servers (90%)
    * Moved nearly all applications to AWS
    * Used 3-year Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances
  * Results:
    * $3.5 million savings over 5 years
    * Enhanced 24/7 business operations
    * Resource optimization (security compliance, disaster recovery)
    * Speed to market (1 day vs. 2-3 weeks to provision new businesses)
    * Operational efficiency (minutes vs. weeks to deploy services)

TCO analysis helps organizations compare on-premises and cloud costs, considering both hard and soft benefits. AWS Pricing Calculator provides tools to estimate costs and identify savings opportunities.
