# Advantages of Cloud Computing

* Advantage #1: Trade capital expense for variable expense
  * Capital expenses (capex): Funds used to acquire, upgrade, maintain physical assets
    * Traditional model: Must pay for everything in data center whether used or not
  * Variable expense: Easily altered or avoided by the bearer
    * Cloud model: "Pay only when you consume resources"
    * "Pay only for the amount you consume"
    * Avoid heavy investment in data centers/servers before knowing use case
    * Adapt to new applications with needed space in minutes vs weeks
    * Reduced maintenance allows focus on core business goals

* Advantage #2: Benefit from massive economies of scale
  * Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in cloud
  * Providers like AWS achieve higher economies of scale
  * Translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices for customers
  * AWS passes savings to customers

* Advantage #3: Stop guessing capacity
  * Eliminates need to predict infrastructure capacity needs
  * Traditional approach: Risk expensive idle resources or limited capacity
  * Cloud computing: Access as much or as little as needed
  * Scale up and down with only minutes' notice

* Advantage #4: Increase speed and agility
  * New IT resources available with just a click
  * Reduces resource availability time from weeks to minutes
  * Dramatically increases organizational agility
  * Lower costs and time for experimentation and development
  * Minutes between wanting resources and having resources vs weeks

* Advantage #5: Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
  * Focus on projects that differentiate your business
  * Concentrate on your customers instead of infrastructure
  * Avoid "heavy lifting" of racking, stacking, powering servers

* Advantage #6: Go global in minutes
  * Deploy applications in multiple AWS Regions worldwide with a few clicks
  * Provide lower latency and better customer experience
  * Simple and minimal cost to expand globally

These six key advantages demonstrate how cloud computing transforms IT from a capital-intensive constraint to a flexible, scalable resource that enables business agility and global reach while reducing costs and maintenance burdens.
