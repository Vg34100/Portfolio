# Course 2: Neural Networks & Decision Trees Overview

* Course Structure and Key Topics
 - Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
   * Week 1: "Neural network inference and prediction"
   * Week 2: "Training neural networks with labeled data (X,Y)"
 - Practical Machine Learning Systems
   * Week 3: Tips for efficient system building
     - "Avoid wasting time on approaches unlikely to work"
     - Guidance on systematic decision making
 - Decision Trees
   * Week 4: Less hyped but "powerful and widely used"
   * High probability of practical application use

* Building ML Systems - Practical Decisions
 - Critical choices:
   * Data collection vs. computational power
   * Resource allocation optimization
   * System architecture decisions
 - Industry relevance
   * Even leading tech companies sometimes spend months on
     non-optimal approaches
   * Course provides framework to avoid such pitfalls

This course combines theoretical foundations of neural networks and decision trees with practical implementation guidance. Focus is on making effective decisions in real-world ML system development to avoid common pitfalls and inefficiencies.
