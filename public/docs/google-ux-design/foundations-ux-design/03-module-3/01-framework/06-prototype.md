* Prototyping Phase Essentials
   * Core Purpose
       - Create early models to show look/function
       - "Not building final product"
       - Test with users/stakeholders
   
   * Information Architecture (IA)
       - High-level organization diagram
       - Key Components
           > Hierarchy: Topic priority/subordination
           > Sequence: Navigation order
           > "Shows how users move through product"
   
   * Prototyping Methods
       - Wireframes
           > Paper: Quick sketches with basic shapes
           > Digital: 2D designs in UX tools
           > Uses placeholder text/grayscale
       
       - Lo-Fi Prototypes
           > Simple interactive model
           > Basic navigation between screens
           > "Test early before detailed development"
           
       - Hi-Fi Prototypes
           > "Close to final product as possible"
           > Full components/interactivity
           > Realistic content/placeholders
           > Enables complete experience testing
   
   * Key Considerations
       - Review against earlier phases
       - Check problem statements
       - Verify user needs met
       - "Prototyping and testing are interconnected"
   
   * Example: Bakery Website
       - Homepage needs clear "Place Order" option
       - Must replicate phone ordering experience
       - Design for Berta's easy navigation
