* Testing Phase Fundamentals
   * Core Purpose
       - "Test prototypes to understand user experience"
       - Cycles with prototyping phase
       - Uncover usability issues/pain points
   
   * Testing Plan Elements
       - Who Tests
           > Early: Friends/colleagues
           > Later: "Real users matching personas"
           
       - Test Types & Data Collection
           > Observations
           > Interviews
           > System/prototype data
           > Must be inclusive/accessible
           
       - When/Where
           > In-person or virtual
           > "Balance needs with business requirements"
           
       - Key Goals
           > Validate design decisions
           > Find usability issues
           > Test information architecture
           > Verify user needs met
   
   * Testing Process
       - Start with lo-fi prototype
       - Move to hi-fi testing
       - Iterate based on feedback
       - "Refine until problem is solved"
   
   * Final Steps
       - Finalize prototype
       - Hand off to developers
       - Convert design to product
