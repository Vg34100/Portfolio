* Design Thinking Framework Overview
   * Core Purpose
       - "Provides guidance on best practices for solving real user problems"
       - Fosters collaboration and innovation
       - User-centered approach using research, prototyping, testing
   
   * Five Phases
       - Empathize
           > Learn about user problems/needs/context
           > "Step away from assumptions"
           > Methods: surveys, interviews, observations
           
       - Define
           > Analyze research to identify key problems
           > Create problem statement
           > Develop value proposition
           
       - Ideate
           > Generate many possible solutions
           > "Judgment-free brainstorming"
           > Collaborate with all stakeholders
           > Create user flows
           
       - Prototype & Test
           > "Test at each stage, not just at end"
           > Types:
               * Simple sketches
               * Low-fidelity (paper)
               * High-fidelity (interactive)
           > Multiple platforms testing
   
   * Key Framework Principles
       - Focus on user
       - Address user problems
       - Cross-department collaboration
       - Validate designs
       - "Iterate as needed"
       
   * Important Notes
       - "Not linear - should be iterative"
       - Can vary between companies/teams
       - Early testing gets better feedback
