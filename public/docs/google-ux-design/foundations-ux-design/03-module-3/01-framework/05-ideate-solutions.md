* Ideation Phase Fundamentals
   * Core Concept
       - "Brainstorm many solutions without judgment"
       - Collaborate with team/stakeholders
       - Ideas can be unexpected/out-of-box
   
   * Key Brainstorming Methods
       - "How Might We" (HMW)
           > Turn problems into opportunity questions
           > Generate multiple answers
           > Example: "How might we make ordering easy?"
       
       - Rapid Sketching
           > 8 squares, 8 minutes
           > One idea per minute
           > Visual solutions focus
           
       - Competitive Audits
           > Study similar products
           > Identify market gaps
           > Learn from others' successes/failures
           
       - SCAMPER Method
           > Substitute
           > Combine
           > Adapt
           > Modify
           > Put to other use
           > Eliminate
           > Rearrange
   
   * Collaboration Process
       - Key Questions
           > Who's involved/roles
           > Location/format
           > Goals/purpose
           > Tools/processes
   
   * Business Requirements Check
       - "Frame parameters as positive constraints"
       - Consider:
           > Budget feasibility
           > Timeline constraints
           > Design standards
       - Use as filter for ideas
   
   * Key Point
       - "Start boundless, then filter through requirements"
