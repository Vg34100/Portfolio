* Design Sprints vs Design Thinking
   * Framework Comparison
       - Design Thinking
           > Five phases: Empathize/Define/Ideate/Prototype/Test
           > "Overall problem-solving philosophy"
           > Open-ended process
           > Multiple methods/tools
           
       - Design Sprints
           > Five phases: Understand/Ideate/Decide/Prototype/Test
           > "Specific implementation for specific challenge"
           > Strict 5-day timeline
           > Single defined process
   
   * Using Sprints in Framework Phases
       - Empathize Phase
           > Quick user research
           > Conduct interviews
           > Analyze feedback
           
       - Define Phase
           > Refine problem statements
           > Align stakeholders
           > Analyze user journeys
           
       - Ideate/Prototype/Test
           > "Generate large volume quickly"
           > Create testable prototypes
           > Collect immediate feedback
   
   * Resources for Learning
       - Google Design Sprint Kit
           > Case studies
           > Templates
           > Activities
       - Recommended Reading
           > Sprint by Jake Knapp
           > Focus on: "Start at End" and "Liftoff" chapters
   
   * Entry-Level Role
       - Bring user perspective
       - Help with sketching/wireframing
       - Assist prototyping/testing
       - "Create meaningful user experiences"
