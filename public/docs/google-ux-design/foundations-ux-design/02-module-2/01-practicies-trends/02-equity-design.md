* Equity-Focused Design Core Concepts:
 - Definition:
   > Making products "accessible and fair to all"
     * Genders
     * Races 
     * Abilities
   > "Must specifically consider underrepresented groups"

 - Forms & Data Collection:
   > Key Considerations:
     * Question necessity
     * Gender-neutral language
     * Bias awareness
   > Example: Gender Selection
     * Poor Design: Male/Female/Other
     * Better Design:
       - Multiple options
       - Write-in field
       - "Includes nonconforming & nonbinary"

 - Real World Examples:
   > Voice Assistants Issue:
     * Initially trained on male English voices
     * Failed with:
       - Female voices
       - Accented speech
     * "Shows importance of diverse testing"
   
   > Visual Representation:
     * Profile Pictures/Avatars should consider:
       - Age
       - Race
       - Gender
     * "Challenge mainstream user images"
       - Use diverse illustrations
       - Include varied representations

 - Implementation:
   > Requires:
     * "Viewing design through critical lens"
     * Considering multiple perspectives
     * Understanding biases
   > "Just starting point - has endless implications"
