* Platforms & Screen Design:
 - "Content must be consistent across platforms"
 - Platforms include:
   > Desktop
   > Mobile web/apps
   > Tablets
   > Wearables
   > TVs/displays
 
* User Interaction Patterns:
 - Mobile vs Desktop Time:
   > Mobile: 72 second sessions
   > Desktop: 150 second sessions
 - Mobile Users:
   > "Goal-oriented, single task focused"
   > Use tapping/swiping
   > Often have connectivity limitations
   > "Must design for all phone costs"

* Design Considerations:
 - Responsiveness:
   > Sites auto-adjust to screen size
   > Example:
     * Desktop: Multiple columns
     * Mobile: Single column
 
 - Mobile Best Practices:
   > Center call-to-action buttons
   > Keep navigation simple
   > Use familiar gestures
   > Design for portrait/landscape
   > "Reduce visual clutter"

* Platform-Specific Design:
 - Desktop/Laptop:
   > More screen space
   > Landscape mode standard
   > Flexible column layouts
 
 - Mobile:
   > Limited space - "make every element count"
   > Portrait mode primary
   > Must consider both orientations
 
 - Other Platforms:
   > Tablets: Blend desktop/mobile experience
   > Smartwatches: Very limited screen space
   > "Consider accessibility across all platforms"
