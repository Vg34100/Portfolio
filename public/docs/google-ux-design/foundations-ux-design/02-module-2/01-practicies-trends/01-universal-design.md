 - Passion:

* Design Evolution for Inclusion
 - Universal Design
   > "One product for widest range of abilities"
   > Problem: "Like one-size-fits-all hat"
     * Loses effectiveness
     * Excludes many users
 
 - Inclusive Design 
   > "Solutions for different needs"
   > Considers:
     * Ability, race, economics
     * Language, age, gender
   > Philosophy: "Solve for one, extend to many"
   > Includes excluded populations in design process
   > Key point: "No such thing as normal user"
     * Focus on blind/deaf needs first
     * Build for additional excluded groups
   
 - Equity-Focused Design
   > "Newest industry goal"
   > Purpose: "Design for historically excluded groups"
   > Equality vs Equity:
     * Equality: Same support for all
     * Equity: Different support for fair outcomes
   > Process:
     * Identify product
     * Find historically excluded groups
     * Center design around them
   
* Implementation Notes
