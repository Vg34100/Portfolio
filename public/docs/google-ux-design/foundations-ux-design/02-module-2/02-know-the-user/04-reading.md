* User-Centered Design and AT (Assistive Technology)
   * Core Concept
       - "Good design incorporates AT throughout entire design process"
       - Used by both people with and without disabilities
       - Examples: pinch-to-zoom benefits all users
   
   * Key AT Types & Implementation
       - Color Modification
           > Light/dark mode toggles in forms
           > Helps prevent missing key instructions/features
       
       - Switch Devices
           > Replaces keyboard/mouse functionality
           > "Keyboard navigation is required by law in many places"
           > Must be considered early to avoid redesign work
       
       - Voice Control (VUI)
           > Allows voice interaction instead of physical controls
           > Design process requires studying how users naturally express commands
           > Multiple command options for same tasks
       
       - Screen Readers
           > Reads text and alt text aloud
           > Alt text describes non-textual elements
           > "Only include alt text for meaningful images, not decorative ones"
   
   * Daily AT Examples
       - Closed captions
       - Smart speakers
       - Tab key navigation between fields
