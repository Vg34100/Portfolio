   > Avoid leading words that guide user responses
   > Bad: "Do you like the improved layout?"
   > Good: "Explain how you feel about the layout"
   
 - Bandwagon Effect
   > Group opinion influence on individual thoughts
   > Prevention: Have participants write thoughts before group discussion
   
 - Confirmation Bias in Surveys
   > Avoid limiting answer options
   > Use measurable questions (quantitative data)
   > Allow for open-ended responses
 
 - False Consensus Prevention
   > Let users follow their own paths
   > Don't interrupt their flow
   > Ask them to narrate their journey

     - Watch for mixed signals
     - Ask clarifying questions
     - Make participants comfortable
   > Social Desirability Bias
