# Accessibility in Empathy-Driven Design

* Understanding Disability Types
   - Three Categories:
       * Permanent: "Betty with one arm"
       * Temporary: "Angela with sprained wrist"
       * Situational: "Juan holding newborn"
   - Common Goal
       * All need one-handed operation
       * Share same user objectives

* Design Considerations
   - Critical Understanding Required
       * Different journeys for different abilities
       * Consequences of exclusion
           - Example: Fire escape routes ignoring wheelchair users
   - Research Methods
       * Have conversations with disabled users
       * Learn about assistive technologies
       * Watch expert demonstrations

* Keyboard Accessibility
   - Important for Multiple Users
       * Some rely solely on keyboard navigation
       * Required by Americans with Disabilities Act
   - Common Interactions
       * Form field navigation
       * Submit button operations
       * Alternative to mouse usage
   - Enables Other Tools
       * Switch devices
       * Various assistive technologies

Designing for accessibility requires understanding diverse user needs across permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities. Good accessible design creates inclusive experiences that benefit all users, not just those with specific disabilities.
