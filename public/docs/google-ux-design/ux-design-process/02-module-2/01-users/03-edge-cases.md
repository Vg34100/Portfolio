# Edge Cases & Happy Paths

* Happy Path Concept
   - "describes user story with happy ending"
       * User reaches goal without issues
       * Everything works as expected

* Edge Cases
   - Definition: "rare situation or unexpected problem interrupting standard experience"
   - Example Case: Iyla's Flower Purchase
       * UK user trying to send flowers in US
       * Required state field blocks completion
       * No way to fix on user's end
       * Forces user to abandon purchase

* Pro Tips for Managing Edge Cases
   - Create Comprehensive Materials
       * Wide variety of personas
       * Diverse user stories
       * Account for vulnerable users
   - Review Process
       * "thoroughly review project before launch"
       * Don't focus only on happy path
       * View from user's perspective
   - Use Wireframes
       * Helps visualize project
       * Identify potential pain points
       * Fix issues pre-launch

* Designer's Role
   - "anticipate what needs users might have"
   - Keep users on happy path
   - Create repairs for broken experiences
   - Plan for unexpected scenarios

Edge cases represent crucial breaking points in user experience that can derail even the most carefully planned user journeys. Good UX design anticipates these potential failures and creates pathways back to successful completion for all users, regardless of their situation.
