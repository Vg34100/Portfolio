# Detailed User Story Construction

* Core Definition
   - "fictional one-sentence story from persona's POV"
       * Informs design decisions
       * Uses imagination to capture user needs

* Story Structure Template
   - Format: "As a [WHO], I want to [WHAT], so that [WHY]"
       * WHO = type of user
       * WHAT = desired action
       * WHY = intended benefit
   - Best Practice: "keep short, impactful, and to the point"

* Example Stories for Dog Walker App
   - Safety & Trust Focused
       * "As a frequent traveler... hire consistent walker for pet safety"
       * "As a mother... limit home access for family safety"
       * "As a former officer... track walker for pet comfort"
   - Service Reliability
       * "As a busy executive... trust walkers won't stand up"
       * "As a widowed executive... find permanent walker"
   - Selection Process
       * "As an indecisive student... try many walkers"

* Design Implementation
   - Features should reflect stories:
       * Schedule requests
       * Walker selection
       * Background checks
   - Must address diverse user needs
       * Detailed personas = better design
       * "User always comes first"

User stories transform user needs into actionable design requirements. They serve as a checklist ensuring all key user problems are addressed while keeping the design process focused on real user needs.
