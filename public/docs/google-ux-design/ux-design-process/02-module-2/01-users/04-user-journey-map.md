# User Journey Mapping Fundamentals

* Core Components
   - Definition: "series of experiences a user has achieving specific goal"
   - Builds on:
       * Personas
       * User stories
       * Journey maps ("illustration of user's path to goals")

* Key Benefits
   - Reduces designer bias
       * Forces focus on specific persona needs
       * Documents full interaction sequence
   - Reveals pain points
       * Example: Kindred's census form issue
       * Identifies problems designer might miss
   - Highlights improvement opportunities
       * Solutions can be developed
       * Enhances overall experience

* Journey Mapping Process
   - Identify first task
   - List all required steps
       * Main tasks
       * Smaller subtasks
   - Track emotional journey
       * Consider user feelings at each step
       * Note potential frustrations
   - Find improvement opportunities
       * Example: Jamal's subway journey
           - Need for accessibility keys
           - Elevator/ramp locations
           - Platform navigation help

* Example Tasks (Jamal's Journey)
   - Find subway route
   - Locate accessible station
   - Purchase ticket
   - Navigate to platform

User journey mapping transforms abstract user needs into concrete, actionable steps while considering both physical and emotional aspects of the experience. This comprehensive approach helps designers create more inclusive, user-centered solutions.
