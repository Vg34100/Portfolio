* User Story Definition
   - "fictional one-sentence story from persona's point of view"
       * Also called scenarios or user cases

   - Unite team around clear objectives
   - Enable "user-centered/user-centric" design decisions
   - Help personalize pitches to stakeholders
       * Shows how updates help specific people

* Story Structure
   - Formula: "As a [type of user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"
       * Type of user = who we design for
       * Action = what user hopes will happen
       * Benefit = why user wants the action
   - Contains:
       * Hero (user)
       * Ultimate goal
       * Conflict preventing goal
   - Example:
       * "As an online shopper, I want to receive a text when item arrives
         so I can pick it up right away"

User stories are essential tools for UX designers to understand and address user needs while keeping design decisions focused and user-centric. They transform abstract user needs into actionable, clear objectives that teams can rally behind.
