# Design Thinking: Define Phase Overview

* Moving from Empathize to Define phase
   * Built on previous work:
       - User interviews
       - Pain points identification
       - Personas creation
       - User stories
       - Journey maps

* Key Define Phase Questions:
   - "Which user needs/problems are most important to address?"
   - "How might design address these needs effectively?"

* Problem Statements
   * Template: "[User] is a [type] who needs [experience] because [benefits]"
   * Example:
       - "Berta is older person with visual impairment who needs accessible ordering
         system that mimics phone conversation feel"

* Hypothesis Statements
   * Format: "If [user] can [action], then [benefit]"
   * Moves from problem definition toward solutions
   * Example:
       - "If Berta can place orders in conversation-like system, she'll maintain
         bakery connection"

* Value Propositions
   * Short statements showing product's unique value
   * Key components:
       - What product does
       - Why users should care
   * Addresses:
       - User pain points
       - Unique benefits
       - Key actions/achievements enabled

The Define phase bridges empathy work into actionable problems and solutions. It transforms user research into clear statements that guide solution development while maintaining focus on real user needs.
