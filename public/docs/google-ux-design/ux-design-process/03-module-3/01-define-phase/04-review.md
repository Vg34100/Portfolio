# Problem & Hypothesis Statements Review

* Strong Problem Statements
   * Core Criteria:
       - "Human-centered"
       - "Broad enough for creative freedom"
       - "Narrow enough for practical solution"
   * Components:
       - User persona name
       - Characteristics description
       - Clear user need
       - Actionable insight (why)

* Statement Templates
   * Problem Format:
       - "[Name] is a [characteristics] who needs [need] because [insight]"
       - Example:
           > "Anika is busy intern needing faster group coffee orders
              because individual orders waste time"
   * Hypothesis Format:

       - Practical achievability
   * Hypothesis Elements:
       - Clear solution action
       - Measurable outcomes
       - Builds on problem statement

Problem and hypothesis statements form the bridge between user research and design solutions. They transform user needs into actionable goals while maintaining focus on practical, achievable outcomes.
