# Creating Hypothesis Statements

* Purpose
   * "Educated guess about solution to design problem"
   * Follows problem statement creation
   * Helps narrow research into goals

* Statement Formats
   * If/Then Method
       - Format: "If [name + action], then [name + outcome]"
       - Example:
           > "If Arnold downloads app, then can use simplified mode"
           > "If Tobias signs up, then can quickly find walker"

   * We Believe Method
       - Format: "We believe that [solution] for [user] will [outcome]"
       - Example:
           > "We believe simplified mode for Arnold will allow efficient hiring"
           > "We believe easy access for Tobias will increase walk frequency"

* Key Characteristics
   * Multiple solutions acceptable
       - Different approaches possible
       - Choose best fit for users
   * Flexible approach
       - Can adjust as learning continues
       - Adapts to new user needs
   * Focus Options
       - If/Then: Direct user needs
       - We Believe: Team perspective with user empathy

Hypothesis statements transform problem definitions into potential solutions, bridging research and design. They provide structured ways to propose and test solutions while maintaining user-centered focus.
