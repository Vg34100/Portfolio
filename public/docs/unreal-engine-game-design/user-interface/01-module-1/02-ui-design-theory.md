# UI Design Theory Foundations

* Course Module Coverage
 * Basic workflows for functional UI
 * Design philosophies
   * Focus: Giving players needed information
   * Balance between too much/little information
 * Modular workflows and programming paradigms

* Resources & References
 * gameuidatabase.com
   * 1000+ game UI examples
   * Searchable by categories
     * Inventory, health bars, settings, loading screens
   * Great for inspiration/prototyping reference

* Design Approaches
 * Minimalist Design Philosophy
   * Keep UI simple, clean, small
   * "Focus on world immersion over UI elements"
   * Complementary information that takes backseat
   * Core purpose: Display clear, concise information
 
 * Modular Design Strategy
   * Templates for easy updates/changes
   * Create reusable UI assets
   * Benefits:
     * Quick updates across all UI
     * Faster development with drag-drop components
     * Easier iteration during feedback

* Programming Guidelines
 * Core Rule: "Never store game data within UI"
   * Data belongs in character components/blueprints
   * UI only retrieves and displays information
   * Example: Stats menu gets data from stat actor component
   * Similar to web browsers retrieving/displaying data

Course provides essential UI design principles focusing on player experience, modularity, and proper data handling. Emphasizes balance between information clarity and game immersion.
