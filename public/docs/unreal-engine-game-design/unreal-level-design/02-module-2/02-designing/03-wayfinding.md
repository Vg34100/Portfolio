# Understanding Wayfinding in Level Design

* Wayfinding Definition:  
 - Methods designers use to indicate destinations 
 - Shows players "where they might want to go"
 
* Differs from Affordances:
 - Wayfinding: Indicates destinations
 - Affordances: Shows what players can do
   * "Wayfinding doesn't tell how to get there"
   * "Affordances don't tell where you're ending up"

* Implementation Types:
 - Diegetic
   * Exists within game context
   * Examples:
     - Road signs
     - Billboards
 - Non-diegetic
   * UI elements
   * Examples:
     - Floating arrows
     - Glowing minimap spots

* Signage Approaches:
 - Explicit
   * Clear language-based signs
   * Requires localization consideration
 - Implicit
   * Environmental indicators
     - Biome changes
     - Fog/light changes
     - Up/down indicators

* Examples:
 - Mirror's Edge: Uses color for direction
 - Racing Games: Painted arrows and lit signs
 - Sandbox Games: Directional arrows for tasks
 - Halo Series: "fantastic job mixing implicit and explicit wayfinding"

Wayfinding serves as a crucial tool for guiding players through game environments using both in-game and UI elements. The choice between explicit and implicit methods depends on the game's needs and design philosophy.
