# Level Shaping & Topology

* Levels contain physical shape elements:
 - Topology
 - Architecture 
 - Traversable spaces (2D/3D)

* Two key design approaches:
 - Maps
   * "Topologically and proportionally accurate"
   * Can be top-down/side-on/isometric
   * Used as template for Unreal level
   * More work-intensive
 - Level Diagrams
   * "Not proportionally accurate but topologically accurate"
   * Node-based representation
   * Includes notes/descriptions/annotations
   * Faster iteration

* Example: London Underground Map
 - Shows possible routes
 - Not actual distance-accurate
 - Demonstrates diagram vs map difference

* Level Diagram Creation Process:
 - Start with nodes
 - Connect pathways
 - Add layers/notes
 - Create abstract zones
 - "Align with narrative diagram" if exists

* Tools Needed:
 - Graph paper preferred
 - Pens/pencils
 - Color options helpful
   * Enables different annotation styles

Level shaping requires understanding spatial relationships and having efficient tools for iteration. Starting with diagrams before maps allows faster concept development while maintaining topology accuracy.
