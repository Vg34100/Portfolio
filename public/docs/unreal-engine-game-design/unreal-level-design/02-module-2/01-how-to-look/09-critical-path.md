# Level Critical Path Design

* Critical Path Definition
 - "Main/intended path for player"
   * Minimum path to complete level
   * Ideal movement through level
   * "Optimal player progression route"

* Critical Path Considerations
 - Must align with:
   * Narrative requirements
   * Level intentions
 - Testing importance:
   * May discover unintended paths
   * Player behavior differs from expectations
   * Can reveal new completion methods

* Off-Critical Path Elements
 - Adds:
   * Interest/complexity
   * Side quests
   * Hidden collectibles
   * Additional narratives
   * Game depth

* Example Level Critical Path
 - Path sequence:
   * Start through guardhouse
   * Along cliff face
   * Through sidetracks
   * Boss completion
   * Final exit
 - Notable exclusions:
   * Hidden area (due to valve)
   * Lakeside (side quest)

* Design Process
 - Remember:
   * Theme importance
   * Level intention
   * Consider emergent paths
 - Revise as needed:
   * Iterate diagram
   * Make adjustments
   * Test thoroughly

Critical path forms the backbone of level progression, ensuring core narrative and gameplay goals are met. All additional content should support but not interfere with this primary route while adding depth to the experience.
