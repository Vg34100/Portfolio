# Biomes & Environment Design

* Biome Definition 
 - "Distinct geography with associated flora/fauna"
   * Examples:
     - Grasslands
     - Forest
     - Tundra
     - Desert

* Level Designer Responsibilities
 - Must know:
   * Which biomes level uses
   * Available assets within biome
 - Should research/understand biomes
   * Let inform design choices
   * Example: Desert suggests
     - Large traversal areas
     - Sand mechanics
     - Windstorm visibility effects

* Design Philosophy
 - "Don't let biomes restrict gameplay"
   * Create internally consistent fiction
   * Primary focus: "compelling gameplay"
 - Good examples:
   * Ratchet & Clank series
   * Cyan games
   * Abduction (mixed biomes)

* Sample Level Implementation
 - Elevation layers:
   * Highest: Guardhouse area & distant section
   * Middle: Valley with trees
   * Lowest: Lake area
 - Building masses:
   * Guardhouse: Low profile
   * Abbey: 
     - Defined silhouette
     - Rocky precipice
     - Tower for navigation

Biomes provide framework for level personality while suggesting mechanics, but shouldn't restrict design. Focus remains on compelling gameplay within consistent environment.
