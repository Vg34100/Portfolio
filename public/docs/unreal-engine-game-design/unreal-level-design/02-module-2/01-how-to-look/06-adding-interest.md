# Adding Small-Scale Level Interest Features

* Three techniques to add complexity without changing topology:
 - Sidetracks
 - Backtracks  
 - Pockets

* Sidetracks
 - "Leaves main path and rejoins later"
 - Benefits:
   * Adds realism
     - "Rare in real life to have direct A to B path"
   * Creates narrative opportunities
   * Adds depth/complexity

* Backtracks
 - "Leaves path but doesn't rejoin - creates dead end"
 - Common uses:
   * Maze dead-ends
   * Hidden alleys
   * Places for:
     - Collectibles
     - Narrative moments
     - Pickups

* Pockets
 - "Just a little blip along the way"
 - Properties:
   * Smaller than backtracks
   * Easy to miss
   * Rewards attention
 - Examples:
   * Canyon divots
   * Hidden corners
   * Places for:
     - Ammo/health
     - Collectibles
     - "Rewards for paying attention"

* Implementation Example:
 - Sidetracks:
   * Added to complex traversal areas
   * Allow alternate movement options
 - Backtrack:
   * Hidden area near guardhouse
   * "For completionists seeking 100%"
 - Pockets:
   * Too small for diagram
   * Scattered throughout
   * Creates exploration opportunities

These micro-scale features add depth and reward exploration without changing level structure. They create opportunities for collectibles, narrative moments and completionist content while maintaining core path flow.
