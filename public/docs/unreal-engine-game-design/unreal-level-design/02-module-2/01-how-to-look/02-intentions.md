# Level Design Intentions 

* Critical pre-design consideration: "understand context level sits in"
 * Key elements to examine:
   - Narrative 
   - Mechanics
   - Pacing

* Narrative Requirements
 * Understanding story context:
   - What happened before
   - What needs to be told now 
   - What happens next
 * Example Linear Level Story:
   - Player heading to Abbey
   - Guards interaction reveals mission info
   - Secondary lakeside destination opens side quest
 * Multiplayer Level:
   - Arena-style, no narrative needed

* Mechanics Implementation
 * Key Questions:
   - How much mechanic explanation needed?
   - Is it narrative or tutorial focused?
   - "Need instruction built in - subtle or obvious"
 * Process:
   - List new mechanics
   - Plan introduction methods
   - Integrate into level context

* Pacing and Intensity
 * Consider both:
   - Within individual level
   - Context of entire game
 * Linear Level Example:
   - Starts low intensity (dialogue)
   - Builds through challenges
   - Peaks at boss fight
 * Multiplayer Level Example:
   - Stealth-focused infiltration
   - Brief high intensity during bomb plant
   - Timer creates tension

Level intentions form the foundation of design, requiring careful consideration of narrative integration, mechanic introduction, and pacing structure. Understanding these elements helps create cohesive levels that fit within the larger game context.
