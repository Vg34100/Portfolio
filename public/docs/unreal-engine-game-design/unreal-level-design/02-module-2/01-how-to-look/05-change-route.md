# Advanced Level Route Design Methods

* Three ways to change basic routes:
 - Parallels
 - Misdirects
 - Loops

* Parallels
 - "Two different paths from A to B along same trajectory"
 - Path differences can be:
   * Ecosystem/biome (high vs low elevation)
   * Gameplay types (swimming vs climbing)
 - Most effective when:
   * Both paths visible at start
   * Can see alternate path while progressing
   * Both lead to same endpoint

* Misdirects 
 - "Stops expected route at last moment"
 - Forces alternate path to destination
 - Benefits:
   * Surprises player
   * Changes player expectations
   * Often switches gameplay style
 - Best used near level end

* Loops
 - "Path that returns to starting point"
 - Two scales:
   * Macro: Entire level forms loop
     - Like Uncharted levels
   * Micro: Small section loops back
 - Usually mixed with other paths
 - Benefits:
   * Adds content while reusing assets
   * Creates narrative opportunities
   * Allows new gameplay types

* Example Level Application
 - Start: Guardhouse to Abbey with Lakeside branch
 - Added elements:
   * Parallel: River path vs cliff face
   * Misdirect: Broken bridge forces alternate route
   * Loop: Around lake area

Route variation methods provide ways to create engaging player experiences while managing resources and expectations. Each technique serves different purposes in level flow and player engagement.
