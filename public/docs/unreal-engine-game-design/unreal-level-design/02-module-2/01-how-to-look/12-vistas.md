# Sightlines & Vista Planning

* First 3D level consideration
 - Moving from 2D to player perspective view
 - Consider "what player sees at given place"

* Key Vista Considerations
 - Information reveal timing
 - Establishing focal points
 - Player positioning
 - Elements:
   * Elevation
   * 2D plane composition
   * Contrast
   * Color

* Example Level Vista Points
 - First Major Vista (Gatehouse)
   * Shows entire valley
   * Displays:
     > Silhouetted abbey
     > Possible routes
     > Secondary destinations
   * Located before one-way cliff valve
 
 - Decision Point Vistas
   * Branch to Abbey/Lakeside
     > "Make decision now" moment
   * Cliff face vs riverside choice
     > Shows route options clearly
 
 - Progress Vistas
   * Pre-misdirect view
     > Shows "almost there" moment
     > Sets up for route change
   * Backward view before boss
     > "Reminds player of accomplishments"
   * Final exit vista
     > Shows completion path

Vista planning transforms 2D mapping into 3D player experience. Strategic placement of viewpoints guides player progression while creating memorable moments and clear directional choices.
