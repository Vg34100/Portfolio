# Enclosures & Cover Design

* Enclosures
 - "Opposite of vistas"
 - Key properties:
   * Hides/obfuscates destinations
   * Changes gameplay pace
     - Can be safe zones
     - Or increase intensity (tight combat)
   * Enables controlled narrative moments
 - Purpose: "Playing magic trick with players"
   * Distracts from destination temporarily
   * Makes destination reveal more impactful
   * Creates contrast with open areas

* Cover Design
 - Purpose: "Provides protection from projectiles"
 - Key aspects:
   * Enables movement between safe spots
   * "Must know exact placement for effectiveness"
   * Requires understanding:
     - Combat mechanics
     - Projectile behavior 
     - Opponent patterns

* Buffer Design Rules
 - Definition: Consistent measurements for:
   * Cover heights
   * Jump distances
   * Mantling spots
 - Critical rule: "No in-between sizes"
   * Must be clearly full/half cover
   * Players learn to recognize metrics
   * Inconsistency creates confusion

* Example Level Application
 - Main enclosures:
   * Guardhouse interior (start)
   * Boss fight area (end)
   * Puzzle area
 - Natural enclosures:
   * Cliff face areas
   * Hidden riverside
 - Cover: "Too granular for diagram stage"

Enclosures and cover form critical elements of level pacing and player protection. Proper implementation requires careful attention to metrics and player expectations while maintaining gameplay flow.
