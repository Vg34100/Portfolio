# Level Pathing: Branches & Pinches

* Basic pathing consists of:
 - Branches
 - Pinches 

* Branches
 - "Most simple way to add interest"
 - Offers player choice between points
   * Example: Point A splits to B or C
 - Creates need for more content
   * "Content expands exponentially"
   * Must carefully manage choice amount

* Pinches
 - "Mirror image of branch" 
 - Multiple paths merge to one
 - Benefits:
   * Reduces scope/content needs
   * Provides narrative control
   * Forces specific encounters
   * Can create forced viewpoints
 - Drawback:
   * "Reduces player choice/enjoyment"

* Example Level Structure
 - Start: Guardhouse
 - End: Abbey
 - Branch: Lakeside option
   * Vista shows both destinations
   * Visual distinction:
     - Abbey: Tower/rectangular/cylinder
     - Lakeside: Dip down/flat between hills

* Design Process
 - Start with paper sketches
 - "Don't necessarily get best ideas first go"
 - Need minimum:
   * One source
   * One destination
   * Optional second destination for branching

Basic pathing focuses on managing player choice through strategic use of branches and pinches. The balance between player freedom and controlled progression forms the foundation of level flow design.
