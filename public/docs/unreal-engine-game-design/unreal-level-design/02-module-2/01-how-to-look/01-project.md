# Unreal Level Design Project Introduction

* Project Overview
 * Making a level in Unreal Engine with supporting materials:
   - Pacing diagram
   - Level diagram  
   - 2D level map
   - Unreal Engine whitebox level
   - Level design documentation packet

* Design Process Emphasis
 * "Highly iterative process - won't get it right first time"
   - Constant revision and improvement needed
   - Must find new ways to improve level

* Starting Point: Level Diagram
 * Allows loose ideation process
   - Sketch ideas
   - Figure out issues
   - Test concepts
   - Make changes easily with pencil/paper
 
* Project Parameters
 * Must define:
   - Limited scope
   - Specific mechanics
   - Gameplay limitations
   - Abilities and metrics
 * Need a main theme/hook based on:
   - Mechanics
   - Location 
   - Narrative
   - Pacing/intensity

* Two Demo Levels Being Created
 * Single-Player Linear Level
   - First-person perspective
   - Open landscape with interiors
   - New swinging/grappling mechanic
 * Multiplayer Capture The Flag
   - Team vs team
   - New infiltration mechanic
   - Explosive device planting

* Tools Needed
 * For sketching/planning:
   - Graph paper and pencils/pens recommended
   - Digital tools acceptable

This project introduces creating an Unreal Engine level with comprehensive documentation and planning materials. The emphasis is on iteration and improvement through careful planning before implementation.
