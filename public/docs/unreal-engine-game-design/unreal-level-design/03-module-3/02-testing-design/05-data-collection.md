# Data Collection Ethics & Privacy

* Critical Ethics Considerations:
 - Privacy of test data
   * What data collected
   * Where kept
   * Who accesses it
   * Association with personal info

* Identifiable Data Issues:
 - Types:
   * Names
   * Emails
   * Phone numbers
 - Problems:
   * "Can be exposed"
   * "Very private"

* Good Collection Practices:
 - Option 1: No identity data
   * Consider if tester info needed
   * "Might not need to know anything about them"
 
 - Option 2: Data separation
   * Disassociate identity from trivial data
   * Destroy identity data quickly
   * Analyze trivial data fast
   * Keep analysis, destroy raw data

* Storage Considerations:
 - Ownership important
   * Spreadsheets
   * Databases
   * Systems
 - Storage types:
   * Cloud: "Not owning that data"
   * Local: Has "security issues"

Data collection in testing requires careful consideration of privacy and ethics. While not critical for course work, professional settings must prioritize secure and ethical data handling practices.
