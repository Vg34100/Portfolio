# Game Development Milestones & Testing

* Testing Throughout Development:
 - Continuous testing during development
 - Key milestones linked to specific tests
 - Critical for publisher relationships

* Milestone Types:
 - Vertical Slice
   * Shows sample of all features
     - Player abilities
     - Opponents/obstacles
     - UI/multiplayer capabilities
   * Demonstrates "core actions are present"
   
 - Alpha
   * "Code complete, not content complete"
