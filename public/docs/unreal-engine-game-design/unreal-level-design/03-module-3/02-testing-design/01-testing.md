# Game Testing Fundamentals

* Development Testing Core Concepts:
 - "Critical component in game development"
 - Design thinking process:
   * Development
   * Testing
   * Iteration
 - Cycle repeats for best results

* Testing Types:
 - Fault Testing
   * Finding bugs/faults
   * Making sure:
     - Content is correct
     - Game performs properly
     - No crashes

 - Acceptance Testing
   * Publisher-Developer relationship:
     - Developer provides build
     - Publisher checks against milestones
     - If accepted â†’ more funding

 - Platform Testing
   * Testing for specific platforms
     - Rigorous platform requirements
     - Examples:
       > Controller disconnection
       > Internet drops
       > Content standards

 - Suitability Testing
   * Tests if "game is suitable as intended"
     - Fun factor
     - Meeting original intentions
     - Providing:
       > Ability
       > Choices
       > Challenge
   * "Critical to have intention first"
     - Results must match intention

Testing serves as the backbone of level design iteration, ensuring games meet technical, platform, and design goals. The cycle of development, testing, and iteration helps create polished, engaging experiences that fulfill their intended purpose.
