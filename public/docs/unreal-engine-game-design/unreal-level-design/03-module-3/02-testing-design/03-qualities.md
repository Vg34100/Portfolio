# Test Quality & Data Types

* Closed Testing
 - Only within controlled group
   * Very strong data
   * Not broad/diverse
   * Complete control over conditions
 
* Open Testing
 - No control over test participants
   * More diverse results
   * Less robust data
   * Harder to collect data properly
 
* Data Types
 - Quantitative
   * Based on quantity/volume
   * "Numbers don't lie"
     > More data points = better
     > Allows data analysis
     > "Robust and unopinionated"
 
 - Qualitative
   * Based on quality/personal feedback
   * Anecdotal perspective
     > More detailed responses
     > Creates dialogue
     > Allows follow-up questions

* Course Testing Approach
 - No QA department
 - Rely on:
   * Peers in group
   * Family and friends
   * Show levels and gather feedback

Testing types each offer unique benefits - closed for control, open for diversity, quantitative for objective data, and qualitative for detailed feedback. The mix of methods helps create comprehensive understanding of level performance.
