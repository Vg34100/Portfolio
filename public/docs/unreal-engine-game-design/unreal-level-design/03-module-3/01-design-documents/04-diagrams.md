* Visual Communication in Documentation
 - Text often works for describing intentions
 - Visual language can be:
   * "Faster"
   * "Better" at conveying info
   
* Key Diagram Types for Documents:
 - Level Design Map
 - Level Diagram
   * Simplified version
   * Shows "player choice topography"
 - Beat Charts
   * Shows "intensity over time"
 - Tool Radar Chart
   * Shows player activities in level
   
* Creating New Diagrams
 - May need new ways to show:
   * New game mechanics
   * Complex actions
 - "Figuring out complexities is challenging and exciting"

Visual diagrams serve as efficient tools for communicating level design intentions. While standard diagram types exist, designers should be open to creating new visualization methods as needed for unique mechanics or concepts.
