# Documentation in Level Design

* Importance of Documentation (3 Core Reasons):
 - Intentional Design
   * Writing down helps "stay intentional"
   * Better sense of direction
   * Shows where we "might be going astray"
 
 - Scale Management
   * Games can be "really large"
   * Helps remember level details
   * Places level in "greater context"
   
 - Collaboration Benefits
   * Works with:
     * Game designers
     * Other level designers
     * Testers
   * Helps communicate:
     * Design intentions
     * Problem-solving approaches

Documentation serves as both a personal guide and collaborative tool in level design. It helps maintain focus while ensuring clear communication across the development team.
