   * Team fills in details during development
 - Usage varies by game:
   * Small games (like Tetris): May not need one
   * Large games (like Witcher 3): "Incredible detail"

Level Design Documents serve as comprehensive guides that evolve throughout development. They range from basic outlines to detailed specifications depending on the game's scope and complexity.
