# Types of Game Levels

* Game Categories
   - Abstract games
       * Like Tetris
   - Themed games  
       * Like Rocket League

* Three Primary Level Types
   - Linear Levels
       * Goal/mission focused
       * Player given destination at start
       * Allows focused narratives
       * More designer control
           - Define what happens when
           - Control player movement
   - Open-world Levels
       * Multiple destinations
           - Different weighted importance
       * Player chooses order
       * "Exponentially increases designer work"
       * No distinct linear path
   - Multiplayer Levels
       * Can be linear or open-world
       * Often arena-based competitive
           - Examples: Fortnite, Overwatch
       * Focus on free-for-all competition

* Course Practical
   - Student choice of level type
   - Guidelines/restrictions provided
   - Uses Unreal Engine (first-person)
       * Concepts applicable to any game type
           - Abstract
           - Realistic

Level design encompasses three main categories: linear, open-world, and multiplayer, each with distinct characteristics and design challenges. While this course uses Unreal Engine for realistic first-person implementation, the concepts can be applied universally to any game type.
