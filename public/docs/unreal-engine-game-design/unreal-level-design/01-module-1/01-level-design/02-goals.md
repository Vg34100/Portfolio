# Goals of Level Design 

* Working Definition
   - "Level design is the process used to create emotionally satisfying, atomic 
     experiences using a pre-existing game design"

* Emotional Satisfaction
   - Principal emotion: Success/victory
       * Challenge: Primary means of creating response
   - Other emotions possible:
       * Fear, hope, humor
       * Melancholy, sadness
       * Anger, mindfulness, wonder
   - Context varies:
       * Quick 3-minute dopamine rush
       * 60-70 hour emotional journeys
   - "Goal is to define emotions we hope to achieve and use design to create them"

* Narrative Role
   - Stories can be profound
   - "Narrative is simply another tool for emotional response"
   - Emotional response is ultimate goal

* Atomic Experience Concept
   - Levels are singular experiences
       * Must provide value on their own
       * Exist within greater game context
       * Reference previous/future levels

* Pre-existing Game Design
   - Level designers don't create mechanics
       * That's game designer's role
   - Difference explained in next lesson

Level design focuses on crafting emotional experiences within established game mechanics. While narrative and other tools are important, the primary goal is creating satisfying emotional responses through thoughtfully designed atomic experiences.
