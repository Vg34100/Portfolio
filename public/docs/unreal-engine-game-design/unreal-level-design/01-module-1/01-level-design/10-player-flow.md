   - Too Easy (Flat Line)
       * Players get bored
       * Feel time wasted
   - "Sweet Spot"

       * Testing and revision

Flow represents the optimal player state where challenge matches skill, creating engagement without frustration or boredom. Achieving this requires careful design iteration and deep understanding of both game and player psychology.
