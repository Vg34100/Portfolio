# Drama in Level Design

* Drama vs Narrative
   - Different concepts
       * Can have drama without narrative
       * Can have narrative without drama
       * Good narratives usually need drama

* Drama Definition
   - "Level of intensity of play"
       * Rises and falls during gameplay
       * Creates rest periods between action
       * Changing intensity levels

* Level Designer Control
   - Manages intensity
       * Controls tension build-up
       * Designs release points
   - Will learn to chart:
       * Intensity peaks
       * Intensity valleys

Drama in games focuses on controlling play intensity through peaks and valleys, independent of narrative elements. Level designers orchestrate these intensity changes to create engaging experiences, even in abstract games like Tetris.
