# Game Design vs Level Design

* Game Designer Role
  - Creates abstract systems/mechanics
  - Forms game foundation
  
* Level Designer Role
  - Uses existing systems to create experiences
  - "Lives where tire meets the road"
      * Creates actual player experiences
      * Gets direct player feedback
  - "Realizes the fun" vs creating potential for fun

* Analogies for Level Design
  - Musician comparison
      * Doesn't create physics of sound/instruments
      * Creates individual songs/arrangements
      * Makes emotional experiences within album context
  - Chef comparison
      * Doesn't create concept of ingredients/tools
      * Creates multi-course experiences
      * Responsible for textures/flavors/surprises

* Critical Role
  - Engages most closely with player
  - Creates actual player experiences
  - Uses existing tools to craft journeys

Level designers take established game mechanics and craft them into actual experiences, similar to how musicians use instruments to create songs. They are the bridge between game systems and player engagement.
