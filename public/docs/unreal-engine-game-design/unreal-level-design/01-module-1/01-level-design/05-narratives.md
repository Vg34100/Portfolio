# Game Narrative & Interactivity

* Narrative Definition
   - Story with characters
       * Individual goals/desires
       * Developing relationships

* Media Comparison
   - Present in:
       * TV shows
       * Movies
       * Books
       * Non-abstract games
   - Some games emphasize as primary content

* Game Uniqueness
   - "Interactivity differentiates from linear media"
       * Players expect meaningful choice
       * Choices affect narrative
   - Must provide multiple narratives
       * Level designers responsible for conveying these
       * Must work within level context

* Designer Questions to Consider
   - What narratives captivate imagination
   - Which games best carry exciting narrative

Games uniquely offer interactive narratives where player choices matter, setting them apart from other media. Level designers must carefully craft these branching experiences within their levels to support multiple potential story paths.
