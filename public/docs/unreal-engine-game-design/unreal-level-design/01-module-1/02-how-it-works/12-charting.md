# Level Assessment with Charts

* Develop habit of assessment
 * First step: use prior tools/outcomes
   - Narrative use
   - Aesthetic beauty
   - Player flow balance

* Analysis using ranges
 * Beyond binary yes/no
   - Measure "how much" tool is used
     > Small puzzle at start
     > vs entirely puzzle-based

* Radar charts recommended
 * Benefits:
   - Visual encapsulation
   - Better than horizontal bars
   - Quick "vibe check"
     > Metrics stay in same positions
     > Density shows focus areas

Radar charts provide effective visual tool for assessing level design components. Using ranges rather than binary checks allows for more nuanced analysis of how different tools are utilized throughout levels.
