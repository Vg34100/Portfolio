# Critical Level Analysis Approach

* Level design as craft/art
 * Designer obligations:
   - Play many games
   - Gather diverse experiences
   - Real world inspiration

* Two engagement modes
 * Playing levels
   - Primary experience method
   - Provides:
     > Immediate engagement
     > Emotional connection
     > Challenge/reward feel
 * Analyzing levels
   - Watch playthroughs
     > Take detached view
     > Pause for detail
     > See missed areas
     > Observe other approaches

* Personal examples
 * Emotional engagement focus
