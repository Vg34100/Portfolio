# Player Engagement Loop Fundamentals

* Four Step Loop Process
   - "Fundamental part of game design"
   - Steps players use approaching challenge:
       * Observe
           - Collect information with senses
           - "Show all relevant info for good decisions"
           - Passive information gathering
       * Plan
           - Process info for action decisions
           - Must have multiple choices
           - "Point of player creativity"
           - Avoid railroading
       * Execute
           - Put plan into action
           - Tests mechanical ability
           - Controller/input mastery
       * React
           - Assess results
           - "Active synthesis" vs passive observing
           - Questions to consider:
               > Did plan work?
               > What needs changing?
               > Where was the failure?

* Step Characteristics
   - Can take milliseconds
   - Games emphasize different steps
       * Turn-based RPG
           - Heavy observe/plan
           - Light execute
       * Guitar Hero
           - Heavy observe/execute
           - Light plan/react

* Design Considerations
   - Give different weights to steps
   - Vary emphasis through level
   - "Change it up as you progress"

The player loop represents core engagement through observation, planning, execution and reaction. Each game type emphasizes different aspects of this loop, allowing designers to create varied experiences by adjusting step importance throughout levels.
