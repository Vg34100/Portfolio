# Measuring & Data Analysis for Levels

* Subjective vs Objective measurement
 * Personal experience = subjective
   - Different designers have varying opinions
   - Can like/dislike for different reasons
 * Games allow objective measurement via data

* Gameplay Metrics
 * Start/Completion rates
   - Ratio: starts vs completions
   - High drop-off can indicate:
     > Too difficult
     > Too boring
   - Used to fine-tune levels
     > Test difficulty adjustments
     > Watch rate changes
   - Used in Mario Maker 2
     > Main metric = completion rate

 * Heat maps
   - Visual representation of activity
   - Shows:
     > Most traversed areas
     > Problem spots
     > Choke points
     > Unused areas
   - Can record:
     > Player position
     > Firing rates
     > Movement speed
   - "Critical for arena multiplayer maps"

 * Post-release measurement
   - Achievements/badges
     > Mark completion
     > Data for future design

Level measurement combines objective data with subjective experience to improve design. Using metrics like completion rates and heat maps allows designers to fine-tune levels based on actual player behavior rather than assumptions.
