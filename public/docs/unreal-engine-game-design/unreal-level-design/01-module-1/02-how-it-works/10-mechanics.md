# Level Mechanics & Implementation

* Game/Level Designer Difference
 * Game designer: creates mechanics
 * Level designer: implements mechanics

* Level Mechanics Loop
 * Instruction
   - Introduce mechanic to player
     > Explicitly: direct information
     > Implicitly: through obstacles
   - Example: block in side-scroller for jumping

 * Practice/Play
   - Give opportunities to improve
     > Multiple variations
       - High/long jumps
       - Standing/running jumps
   - "Gradually increase difficulty"
     > Keep in flow zone

 * Mastery
   - Test player's mechanic understanding
     > Can be boss fight
     > Or obstacle series
   - "Final exam" before progression

 * Subversion/Surprise
   - Change mechanic expectations
     > Obstacles that look impossible but aren't
     > Obstacles that look possible but aren't
   - Must remain fair
   - Introduces next mechanics loop

* Pacing Considerations
 - Start slow for improvement
 - Ramp up to mastery stage

Level mechanics form core structure through instruction, practice, and mastery, with subversion adding depth. Proper pacing ensures player understanding while maintaining engagement through carefully structured progression.
