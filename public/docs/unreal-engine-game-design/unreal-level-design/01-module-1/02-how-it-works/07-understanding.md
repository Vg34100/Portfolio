# Player Understanding & Affordances

* Understanding/Affordances are design tools
 * Draw upon player's real-world knowledge
 * Games can be:
   - Realistic
   - Create new worlds/physics

* Affordances
 * "Communications from object to person"
   - Tell how to operate/interact
   - Indicate value of interaction
     > New areas behind doors
     > Rewards for actions
 * Based on lived experience
   - Understanding of body movement
   - Object interactions
     > Hand-sized = manipulatable
     > Two handles = heavy/needs help

* Game Implementation
 * Must communicate player abilities
   - Walking on walls
   - Teleporting
   - Object lifting limits
 * Examples:
   - Super Mario
     > Good things from bricks
     > Traversable pipes
   - First/Third Person
     > Highlight climbable edges
   - Portal
     > Color-coded portals
   - Katamari
     > Ball collecting mechanics

Affordances bridge real-world understanding with game mechanics, helping players intuitively grasp how to interact with game worlds. Level designers must effectively communicate both familiar and unique interaction possibilities through careful design choices.
