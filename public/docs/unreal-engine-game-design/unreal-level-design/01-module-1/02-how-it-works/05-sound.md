# Sound Design in Games

* Audio Types
 * Diagetic
   - Within game context
     > Footsteps, wind, weapons
     > Provides feedback without visuals
   - Gives information about:
     > What happened
     > How much happened
     > Who did it
     > Where it happened (3D spatial audio)
   - Creates texture
     > Like visual color schemes
     > Unified/coherent elements

 * Non-diagetic 
   - Outside game world
     > Background music/soundtrack
     > UI sound effects
   - Sets tone/emotion

* Audio Design Elements
 * Contrast-based differences
   - Audio beats = changes in quality
 * Feedback mechanisms
   - Foreshadowing: drips, creaks
   - Completion sounds
   - Transition markers
 * Examples:
   - Outlast: Horror cues
   - Portal 2: Leitmotifs
     > Character/object themes
     > Overlapping for narrative

* Level Designer Role
 - Work with audio designer's library
 - Use sounds effectively
 - Don't create sounds themselves

Sound serves as critical feedback system and emotional driver, potentially comprising over 50% of game experience. Level designers must effectively utilize audio libraries to enhance gameplay through both in-world and external sound elements.
