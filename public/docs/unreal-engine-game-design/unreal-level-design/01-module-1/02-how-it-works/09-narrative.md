# Game Narratives & Level Design

* Narrative Types:
 * Explicit
   - Clearly presented
     > Cutscenes
     > Dialogue
     > Written texts (journals/books)
   - Can be:
     > Linear (no input)
     > Branching (player choice)
   - Requires coordination with writing team

 * Implicit
   - Through environment/audio
     > World details
     > Architecture
     > Audio design
   - Example: BioShock's Rapture
     > Told through statues/structures
   - "Engages deductive thinking"
     > Players find clues/hints
     > Build world understanding

 * Emergent
   - Created through gameplay
   - No predetermined story
   - Examples:
     > Minecraft
     > Dwarf Fortress
   - Designer role:
     > Define procedural parameters
     > Not crafting specific plots

* Designer Responsibility
 - Work with narrative team
 - Ensure robust storytelling
 - Add narrative opportunities in level

Narrative serves as powerful engagement tool through explicit presentation, environmental storytelling, or emergent gameplay. Level designers must effectively implement all types while coordinating with narrative teams.
