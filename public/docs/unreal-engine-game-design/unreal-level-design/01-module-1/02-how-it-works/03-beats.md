# Level Design Beats & Intensity

* Levels as time-based medium
 * Must consider duration for completion
 * Change defines time
   * Contrast creates the change:
     - Light to dark
     - Quiet to loud 
     - Still to busy
     - Passive to active
   * Changes can be:
     - Stark/abrupt
     - Gradual

* Beats in level design
 * Term borrowed from movies
 * Defined by changes and contrast
 * Forms series throughout level
   - Describes level intensity
   - Can rise or fall
   * After intense action:
     - Give time to relax/recover

* Intensity visualization
 * Beat/intensity chart shows:
   - Time on horizontal axis  
   - Intensity on vertical
   - Plots action rises/falls
 * Multiple types of action exist
 * Multiplayer note:
   - Less granular control over intensity

Beats and intensity form the core structure of level pacing, using contrast and changes to create engaging experiences. The careful balance of action and rest allows players to experience varying levels of engagement throughout gameplay.
