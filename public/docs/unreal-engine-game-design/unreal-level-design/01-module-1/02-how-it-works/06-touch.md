# Touch & Haptic Feedback in Games

* Controller Haptics History
 * 1997 introduction
   - Nintendo Rumble Pak
   - Sony's DualShock
 * Modern evolution
   - Almost all consoles now include
   - Adaptive controller buttons
     > Variable resistance
     > Based on gameplay

* Haptic Design Purpose
 * Provides feedback/information
   - Two data points:
     > Event timing (when)
     > Duration (how long)
   * Creates feedback beats through:
     > Quick momentary effects
     > Long buzzing hits
 * Enhances immersion
   - More engaging than sight/sound alone
   - "Feels more real"

* Future Developments
 * VR innovations
   - Haptic gloves
     > Simulates holding objects
   - VR treadmills
     > Allows walking/running in place

Haptic feedback has evolved from simple vibrations to complex adaptive systems that enhance player immersion. As technology advances, particularly in VR, touch feedback continues to expand possibilities for player interaction and immersion.
