# Sight & Visuals in Level Design

* Visual design as primary game design tool
 * 2D projection of color/light (like film/painting)
   - Can use art history techniques/tools

* Color & Emotional Response
 * Cultural/learned associations
   - Red = stop
   - Green = go
 * Game Examples:
   - Alan Wake: cool PNW colors w/ red points of interest
   - Journey: warm yellow to cold blue progression

* Color Schemes
 * Types:
   - Monochromatic (narrow range)
   - Complementary (opposite colors)
   - Split complementary (offset opposites)

* Tone (light/dark contrast)
 * Control over lighting
   - Example: Dead Space uses darkness + small lights
   - Creates moody/spooky atmosphere

* Composition Elements
 * Form/Shape
   - Draws eye through contrast
   - Shape language important for games
   - Journey example: pyramid vs soft curves
 * Proportion/Scale
   - Shadow of Colossus: tiny human vs huge creatures
 * Perspective
   - Converging lines create focus
   - Interior/exterior leading lines
   - "Not just a crutch of optics"

* Visual Control
 * 3D environment challenges
   - Less control than film
   - Must sometimes force viewpoint
 * Depth layers
   - Foreground/midground/background
   - Parallax in side-scrollers
   - Character often serves as foreground

Visual design serves as fundamental tool for crafting player experience through careful manipulation of color, tone, and composition. These elements work together to guide players and create emotional responses through intentional design choices.
