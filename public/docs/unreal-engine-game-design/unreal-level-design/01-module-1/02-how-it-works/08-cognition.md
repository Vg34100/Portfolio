# Understanding Player Cognition

* Game requires active thought + physical ability
 * Player engagement loop:
   - Planning
   - Reacting

* Types of Player Thinking
 * Learning mechanics
   - Understanding abilities
   - Learning obstacles/opponents
   - Environmental effects
   > Benefits:
     - Allows design shortcuts later
     - Can subvert expectations

 * Overcoming challenges
   - "Demonstrate creativity"
   - Multiple strategies/tactics allowed
     > Shows player skill in:
       - Planning
       - Execution

 * Puzzle solving
   - Uses:
     > Math/verbal skills
     > Deductive reasoning
     > Previously learned knowledge

* Design Considerations
 * Potential issues
   - Unexpected gating
     > Too difficult puzzles
     > Missing information
     > Unknown abilities
 * Information types
   - Diegetic (in-game fiction)
     > Example: teleport scroll effects
   - Non-diegetic (outside knowledge)
     > Example: chemical reactions
     > "Must supply context in-game"

Player cognition forms core engagement through active thinking and problem-solving. Level designers must balance challenge with accessibility while providing necessary context for both in-game and external knowledge.
