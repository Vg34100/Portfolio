# Unreal Level Design Project Introduction

* Project Overview:
 - Making a level in Unreal Engine with supporting materials:
   * Pacing diagram
   * Level diagram  
   * 2D level map
   * Unreal Engine white box level
   * Level design documentation packet
 
* Key Process Points:
 - "Highly iterative process - won't get it right first try"
   * Continuous revision/improvement of:
     - Levels
     - Level design
     - Documentation
 
* Initial Approach:
 - Starting with map/overall design
 - Level diagram as entry point because:
   * Allows loose ideation process
   * Can sketch and figure out problems
   * Easy changes with pencil/paper before computer work
 
* Project Guidelines:
 - Need defined limitations for:
   * Scope
   * Mechanics
   * Gameplay
 - Must pick a theme/"main hook" which could be:
   * Mechanics
   * Location  
   * Narrative
   * Pacing/intensity ideas

* Project Specifics:
 - First Person perspective focus
 - Two demonstration levels:
   * Single player linear level:
     - Open landscape with interiors
     - New swinging/grappling mechanic
   * Multiplayer capture the flag:
     - Team vs team
     - New infiltration mechanic
     - Explosive device planting

* Tools Needed:
 - For level diagram/map planning:
   * Graph paper, pencils, pens
   * Or tablet/computer if preferred

This project introduces creating an Unreal Engine level through an iterative design process, combining both documentation and hands-on development. The focus is on practical first-person gameplay mechanics while maintaining clear scope limitations.
