# Understanding Greyboxing

* Definition and Origin:
 - Term comes from using "grey/white boxes to mock up level"
 - Uses primitive shapes with:
   * No texture information
   * No color information
 - Creates distinction between:
   * Digital mock-up
   * Level with full assets

* Core Purpose:
 - Keeps level simple for:
   * Playing around
   * Iteration
   * Changes
   * Testing
 - "Nothing is precious":
   * Can toss anything without remorse
   * No remaking of assets needed
 - Primary goal: Testing gameplay without art assets

* Final Stage Process:
 - After greybox finalization:
   * Start incorporating real assets
   * Replace greybox with:
     - Environmental artist assets
     - Prop artist assets
   * Begin populating/set dressing level

Greyboxing is a foundational level design technique using simple shapes to test gameplay before committing to final art. This approach maximizes iteration potential while minimizing resource waste.
