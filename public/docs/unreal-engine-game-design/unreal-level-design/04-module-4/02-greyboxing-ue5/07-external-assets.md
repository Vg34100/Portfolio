# Using External Assets in Unreal

* Built-in Project Assets
 - Found in two main locations:
   * Level Prototyping Directory:
     - Materials, meshes, textures
     - Basic assets: cubes, cylinders, ramps
   * Starter Content:
     - Architecture: walls with doors/windows
     - Props: chairs, lamps, stairs
     - Blueprints: 
       > BP Light Studio for basic lighting setup
       > Provides skylight, directional light, atmosphere

* Epic Games Marketplace
 - Access: Window menu > Marketplace
 - Key sections:
   * Monthly free items
   * "Permanently free collection"
     - Environment assets
     - Modular designs
     - Props
   
* Quixel Bridge
 - Window menu > Quixel Bridge
 - Contains Megascans collection:
   * 3D assets
   * Building components
   * Modular assets
 - Found in content drawer under "Megascans"
 - "Use snapping for quick alignment"

* Important Consideration:
 - Balance between:
   * Quick setup with premade assets
   * Custom design needs
 - Remember: "Nothing is precious"
   * Can toss/replace with custom assets

External assets provide quick prototyping options through built-in content, marketplace items, and Megascans. The key is balancing speed vs customization while maintaining flexibility to change assets as needed.
