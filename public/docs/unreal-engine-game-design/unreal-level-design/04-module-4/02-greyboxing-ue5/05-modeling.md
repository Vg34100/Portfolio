# Advanced Building Tools in Unreal

* Modeling Mode Access & Overview:
 - Switch from selection to modeling mode
 - Tools found on left side panel
   * Each has sub-tools within

* Cube Grid Tool:
 - "Like Sketchup" - push/pull geometry
 - Controls:
   * E key: pulls up
   * Q key: pushes down
   * Z key: exits corner mode
 - Grid settings:
   * Can adjust power for detail level
   * Can rotate grid orientation
   * Outputs as static mesh

* Create Tools:
 - Box Creation:
   * Set width/depth/height
   * Adjust subdivisions for deformation
 - Cylinder Creation:
   * Radial slices for smoothness
   * Boolean operations for hollowing
 
* Advanced Techniques:
 - Plane Cut:
   * Creates angled cuts through geometry 
 - PolyGroup Edit:
   * Most powerful tool
   * Selection filters: vertices/edges/faces
 - CutFaces:
   * Creates separate objects
 - PolyCut:
   * Punches holes through geometry
   * Multiple shape options

* Built-in Stairs Tool:
 - Adjustable parameters:
   * Step count/width/height/depth
   * Can make curved stairs
   * "Very useful for level designers"

Modeling mode provides powerful built-in tools for creating complex geometry without external software. These tools range from simple push/pull operations to advanced mesh editing, enabling quick level prototyping.
