# Setting Up Project Scale in Unreal

* Project Creation:
 - Use First Person Template
 - Create empty level (File > New Level)
 - Create Coursera folder for materials

* Initial Setup:
 - Add directional light for sunlight
 - Place cube for spatial reference
 
* Image Preparation:
 - Format map for engine:
   * 3:2 proportion
   * 3000px width, 2000px height
 
* Engine Organization:
 - Create folder structure:
   * Coursera/
     - Textures/
     - Materials/
       > Prefix material with 'm_'
       > Set base color to texture
       > Sample texture across material

* World Scale Setup:
 - Place plane in world:
   * Center using reset button
   * Scale: 750 wide, 500 deep
   * "Middle mouse as ruler":
     - 75,000 units = 750 meters
     - 50,000 units = 500 meters
 
* Final Steps:
 - Apply texture to plane:
   * Drag and drop from content browser
 - "Sets up project at correct scale"
 - Save project

This section covers setting up proper project scale in Unreal Engine, focusing on importing and scaling a level map for use as a building reference. The process establishes correct proportions for subsequent landscape and gameplay asset creation.
