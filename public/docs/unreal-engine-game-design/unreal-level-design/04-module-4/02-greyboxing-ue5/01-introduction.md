# Course Assessment Guidelines

* Requirements for course assessment:
 - Peer comparison elements:
   * Map to greybox suitability
   * Goals alignment
   * Accuracy in planning
   * Map-to-level representation
   * Changes made and reasoning

* Important considerations:
 - Project scope limitations:
   * Not a full game
   * Starting level only
   * "Think small, think awesome"
   * Must be completable
 - Balance between:
   * Being ambitious
   * Keeping manageable size

This introduces the assessment criteria for the course project, emphasizing the balance between ambition and scope. Focus is on creating a well-planned, reasonably-sized level that can be properly executed and justified.
