* Master Material Homework Requirements:
 - Create PBR master material with parameters:
   > Base color, metallic, roughness, emissive, normal channels
   > Can add additional channels beyond these basics
 - Create 5 unique material instances
   > Suggested types:
     • Metal, plastic, wood, cloth, stone
     • Neon signs (using emissive)
     • Mixed materials (partial metal/rough areas)

* Demo Room Setup Tips:
 - Location options:
   > First project
   > New "materials" project
   > Content examples (File > New Level > Demo Room Base)
 - Room customization:
   > Adjustable number of rooms
   > Display options:
     • Cubes, spheres, planes or mix
     • First room: master material
     • Other rooms: instances
 
* Lighting Setup:
 - "Default lighting at -46 degrees gives nice flat ambient look"
 - Test materials under different conditions:
   > Flat ambient
   > Over/underexposed
   
* Example Homework Showcase:
 - Room layout:
   > First room: Modified master material
   > Second room: 5 spaces (1000 units apart)
 - Material examples:
   > Basic stone (megascan textures)
   > Brick wall (heavy normal maps, low roughness)
   > Colored plastic (bright)
   > Experimental texture (porous/leather/alien skin)
   > Grimy gold (ocean-buried, logo stamped)
     • Uses roughness/metallic maps
     • Modified UV scale for multiple logos

* Creative Suggestions:
 - Add color masking (A/B colors)
 - Implement roughness min-max
 - Use multi-switch technique in:
   > Emissive channel
   > Roughness channel
   > Base color
