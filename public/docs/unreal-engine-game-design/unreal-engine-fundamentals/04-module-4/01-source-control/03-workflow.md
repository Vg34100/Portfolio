# Source Control Team Workflow Example

* Basic Setup
   * Team Structure
       - Developer A (Quinn)
       - Developer B (Manny)
       - Developer C (Team Lead)
       - Art Director
       - "Server/Depot = source of truth"

* Asset Creation Flow Example: Flower
   * Version 1 Process
       - Dev A creates incomplete flower 
       - Missing stem
       - Uploads to server
   * Version 2 Process
       - Dev B downloads v1
       - Adds stem
       - Uploads completed flower
   * Version 3 & 4
       - Art Director requests blue (v3)
       - "Changes mind back to green"
       - Dev B downloads v2
       - "Re-uploads as v4 for timeline consistency"

* Key Timeline Points
   * Dev A: Creates initial (v1)
   * Dev B: Adds stem (v2)
   * Color Change: Blue version (v3)
   * Final: "Return to green as v4 (not v2)"
       - "Maintains version history"
       - "Prevents timeline confusion"

Source control workflow enables organized asset development through clear version progression. The system maintains history while allowing for revisions, ensuring team coordination and proper documentation of changes.
