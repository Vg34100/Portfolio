# Sound Cues & Node System

* Sound Cues - Core Concept
   * Acts as container for audio behavior information
       - Made up of sound nodes
       - Nodes = individual modules affecting sound design
       - Uses graph to show relationship between nodes

* Creating Sound Cues
   * Right click > Audio > Sound Cue
       - Double click to open editor
   * Editor Components
       - Left side: node details
       - Right side: node palette
       - Top: menu bar (solo, mute, play controls)
   * Connection Methods
       - Drag nodes from palette
       - Right click to search nodes
       - Pull pins to connect

* Quick Setup Method
   * For Multiple Sound Assets
       - Select all sound waves
       - Right click > "Create Single Sound Cue"
       - Auto-connects to random node

* Important Sound Nodes
   * Random
       - Plays different sound each trigger
   * Looping 
       - Continuous sound playback
   * Others
       - Envelope: volume/pitch manipulation over time
       - Mixer: combines concurrent sounds
       - Modulation: random volume/pitch
       - Attenuation: distance-based volume

Sound cues serve as sophisticated containers for managing game audio behavior through interconnected nodes. The system allows for complex sound design while maintaining simple setup methods for basic implementations.
