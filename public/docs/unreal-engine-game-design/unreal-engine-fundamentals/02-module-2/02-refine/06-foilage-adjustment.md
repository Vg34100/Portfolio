# Foliage Material Instance Adjustments

* Key Material Settings:
  - Albedo Overlay: Controls base color intensity
  - Color Variation: 
    * Keep subtle (0.01-0.02 range)
    * Prevents uniform appearance without looking unnatural
    
* Wind Settings:
  - Enable wind for natural movement
  - Important controls:
    * Wind intensity
    * Wind height
    * Wind speed
  - Subtle movement recommended for realism

* Layer Sample Names:
  - Must match between landscape layer and sample layer
  - Important behaviors:
    * Matching names auto-populates grass on entire layer
    * Useful for combining grass with texture layers
    * Can separate for more precise control
    
* Painting Controls:
  - Normal paint: Adds foliage
  - Shift + paint: Erases foliage
  - Layer-specific: Erasing one layer doesn't affect others

The key to realistic foliage is subtle variation in both color and movement, with careful consideration of layer naming for desired painting behavior.
