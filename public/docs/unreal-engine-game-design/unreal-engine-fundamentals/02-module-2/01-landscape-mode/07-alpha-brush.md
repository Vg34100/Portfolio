* Alpha Brush Basics:
 - Uses RGB channels for different landscapes:
   * Red = mountain range
   * Green = singular mountain peak
   * Blue = plateau/canyon
 - "Multiple landscapes packed in one image"

* Creation Process:
 - In Photoshop:
   * Import grayscale heightmaps
   * Combine into single file
   * Set blending options per layer:
     - Layer 1 = R channel
     - Layer 2 = G channel
     - Layer 3 = B channel
   * "Export as 4K PNG"

* Using Alpha Brushes:
 - Setup:
   * Change brush type to Alpha
   * "4K heightmaps work best at 4096 size"
   * Auto-rotate can be disabled for control
 - Strength Settings:
   * 0.3 = very faint
   * 3.0 = visible impact
   * 6.0 = dramatic change
   
 - Clay Brush Option:
   * "Adds on top like real clay sculpting"
   * "Better for building up features"
   * Tool size affects resolution quality:
     - Small = less detail transfer
     - Large = better heightmap detail

* Key Tips:
 - "Need large enough brush for proper detail transfer"
 - Single click can create entire landscape base
 - "Experiment with different channels/sizes"
 - Can erase/flatten to restart
