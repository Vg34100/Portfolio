# Water Tools

* Initial Setup:
  - Enable Water plugin (experimental)
  - Enable Water Extras for samples
  - Requires landscape with edit layers enabled

* Ocean Creation:
  - Use Water Body Ocean
  - Creates:
    * Ocean body
    * Water zone
    * Landscape water brush manager
  - Spline-based island shaping
  
* Key Ocean Settings:
  - Terrain Controls:
    * Channel depth
    * Curve ramp width (shoreline to depth transition)
    * Edge offsets
    * Float curve
  
  - Wave Settings:
    * Water depth
    * Max wave height
    * Wave direction
    * Gesner water waves control
    
  - Shoreline:
    * Distance from water edge
    * Gradation settings
    
* Effect Controls:
  - Curl noise (large/small):
    * Tiling sizes
    * Curl amounts
  - Displacement
  - Smooth blending
  - Terracing

* Material Adjustments:
  - Key parameters:
    * Absorption (water color)
    * Refraction
    * Water albedo
  - Multiple categories:
    * Detail normal
    * Fluid simulation
    * Foam settings
    * Global parameters

Best results come from careful adjustment of depth transitions and subtle use of effects like curl noise.
