# Interactive Button Setup & Implementation

* Button Creation (child of BP_Trigger)
 * Components & Visuals:
   - Added Cube component as visual representation
   - Adjusted size for button appearance

 * Interaction Setup:
   - Added BPI_Interact interface
     > Verb set to "Push"
     > Noun set to "Button"
   - On Interact:
     > Calls OnTriggered (true)
     > Visually indents button (-10 on X axis)

 * Timer Implementation
   - Added float variable for timer
   - Set Timer by Event added
     > 0 = instant trigger
     > Higher values = delayed response
   - OnButtonTriggered function created for timeout
     > Resets button position (0,0,0)
     > Calls triggered (false)

 * Scene Placement
   - Positioned on wall
   - Rotated 90 degrees for proper wall mounting
   - Connected to door through trigger parent class

 * Testing
   - "Push button" prompt appears when approached
   - Triggers door unlock on interaction

Created an interactive button system with visual feedback and optional timer functionality. Successfully implements the trigger parent class while adding button-specific interaction behavior.
