# Blueprint Strengths & Limitations Overview

* Blueprint Capabilities
 * Complete Game Development
   - Can make entire games (eg: "Mimic made entirely in blueprints")
   - Runs efficiently
 * Rapid Iteration Benefits
   - Quick changes to gameplay
   - Fast prototyping
     • Instant compile and play testing
     • Easy modifications

* Programming Context
 * Works alongside C++
   - Important for programmers to understand relationship
   - Shares familiar concepts
     • Functions
     • Variables
     • Loops
   - Easy transition from C++/C#

* Limitations
 * Access Restrictions
   - Some features reserved for source code only
     • Example: changing default gravity direction
 * Performance Considerations
   - C++ preferred for:
     • Heavy computational tasks
     • Multiple interacting for loops
     • Resource-intensive operations

Blueprints offer powerful game development capabilities with some technical limitations. While suitable for complete game creation, understanding its relationship with C++ helps maximize its potential for different development needs.
