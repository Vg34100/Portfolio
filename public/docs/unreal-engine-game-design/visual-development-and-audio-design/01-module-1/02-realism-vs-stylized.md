# Realism vs Stylized Art Styles

* Impact & Audience
 - Art style dramatically impacts:
   * Game design
   * Target audience
   * Player preferences
 
* Common Genre Patterns
 - Horror → Heavy realism
 - Platformers → Stylized
 - Technical shooters → Realism
 - Arena/hero shooters → Stylized

* Art Style Scale Examples
 - One end: Hyper-realism 
   * UE's metahumans shows realism capabilities
 - Middle ground:
   * Fortnite (hybrid approach)
 - Other end: Full stylization
   * The Plucky Squire (cute shapes, bright colors)

* Decision Factors
 - Practical considerations:
   * Budget constraints
   * Time frame
 - Must maintain cohesion between:
   * Characters
   * Environment
   * UI

* Development Process
 - Art direction can be "political within company"
   * Final decisions typically rest with art team/director
 - Uses tools like Venn diagrams for vision
 - "Constantly tweaked and iterated" for cohesive aesthetic
 - Goal: Create "unique and interesting" worlds

Art style serves as a crucial foundation for game identity, balancing practical constraints with creative vision. The choice between realism and stylization shapes both the development process and player experience.
