# Camera Mechanics & Effects

* Camera Shake
 - Major impact enhancer for actions
   * Different variations possible:
     > Low rumble during fireball charge
     > Heavy shake on hit
     > Weight relative to damage
     > None on miss
 - "Can cause motion sickness if done wrong"
   * Never use in VR

* Camera Lag
 - Creates smooth transitions
 - Types:
   * No lag
     > Instant following/turning
   * Rotational
     > Character rotates ahead
     > Camera catches up w/sway feeling
   * Positional
     > Camera stays slightly behind
     > Catches up when char stops
 - "Not one-fits-all solution"

* Other Mechanics
 - Field of View
   * Distorts camera view range
   * Used for:
     > Sprint effects
     > Dashing
     > Fast driving
 - Camera Quality Effects
   * Disorientation tools:
     > Flash grenades
     > Concussion effects
     > Blur effects

* Optimization Impact
 - First/Third Person
   * Full rotation = more rendered objects
   * Close-up chars need more detail
 - Top-down/Isometric
   * "More controlled visual experience"
   * Easier to evaluate visible objects
   * Distance allows less char detail

Camera mechanics significantly enhance game feel and immersion through various effects, while also impacting game optimization based on perspective choice. Each mechanic must be carefully balanced for the specific game's needs.
