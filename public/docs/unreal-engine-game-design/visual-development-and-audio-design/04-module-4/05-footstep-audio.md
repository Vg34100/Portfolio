# Implementing Footstep Audio System

* Sound Effect Implementation
 - Can use footstep sounds creatively (grass sounds for sand)
 - "Improvise during development, swap effects later"

* Animation Setup
 * Scene Adjustments
   - Reset preview scene settings
     > Show environment and floor
     > Remove attached assets
 * Adding Notifies
   - Right click timeline when foot hits ground
     > Add "footstep" notify 
     > Add for each foot contact
   - "Can copy/paste notifies between animations"

* Blueprint Logic
 * In Animation Blueprint
   - Add notify footstep to graph
   - Use "play sound at location" node
     > Get actor location
     > Subtract 100 from Z value
 * Sound Array System
   - Convert sound to variable array
   - Use random node for selection
   - "Add 10 different sound files to prevent repetition"

* Sound Refinement
 * Volume Control
   - Random range for volume multiplier
     > Test 0.4-0.5 (too low)
     > Adjust to 0.7-0.8
 * Timing Adjustments
   - Move notify earlier for "crisp" sound
   - Apply to all walk/run animations

Footstep audio implementation combines animation timing with randomized sound selection and volume variation to create natural-sounding movement. System emphasizes avoiding repetition while maintaining realistic timing for improved immersion.
