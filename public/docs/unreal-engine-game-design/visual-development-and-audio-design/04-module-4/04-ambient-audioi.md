# Implementing Audio Systems in Unreal

* Audio Component Setup
 * Player Controller
   - Create BP_PlayerController_Coursera
   - Add audio component in details
     > Set sound to background queue
     > "Auto plays ambient sound on game start"

* Sound Cues
 * Fire Queue Example
   - Place near relevant objects (oven)
   - "Volume changes based on player distance"
   - Creates ambient experience

* Music Change System
 * Interface Creation
   - Make Interface_PlayerController_Coursera
   - Implement in player controller
 * Music Transition Logic
   - Fade out (1s duration)
   - Set new sound
   - Fade in (1s)
   - "Track current vs new music"

* Music Changer Actor
 * Core Components
   - Box collision (500x500x500)
   - Custom collision: overlap pawn only
 * Implementation
   - Cast overlap to character
   - Get controller
   - Use music change interface
   - "Instance editable music variable"
 
* Optimization
 * Added Features
   - 1s delay between fades
   - Check if music is different
   - "Duplicate changers at temple entrances"
   - Set different music for in/out of temple

Audio implementation creates immersion through ambient sounds and dynamic music transitions. The system uses distance-based volume and zone triggers to seamlessly change audio based on player location.
