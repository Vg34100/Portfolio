# Animation Module Review Summary

* Core Technical Features in Unreal
 - Animation Blueprints
   * Event graph
   * Animation graph
 - Animation Components
   * Sequences: single animations from Blender/Control rig
   * Notifies: code triggers at specific times
   * Montages: compile sequences for player actions
     - Used for attacks and blocks
   * Blend spaces: smooth transitions on 2D graph

* Animation Types/Tools
 - Procedural Animation
   * Uses math, physics, code
 - Motion Capture
   * High quality results
   * High upfront cost
 - Mixamo
   * "Thousands of available animations"

* Project Implementation Achievements
 - Movement Mechanics
   * Dodge
   * Air dash
   * Double jump
 - Polish Features
   * Blend per bone node
   * "Allows two simultaneous animations"
 - Created blend spaces
   * "For future game design prototyping"

Animation module covered essential Unreal Engine features and practical implementation of complex movement systems. Focus was on both technical understanding and practical application through blend spaces and movement mechanics.
