# Initial Project Setup in Unreal

   - Named "Corsera_Game"

* Folder Structure Setup
 * Main Content Organization

     > Added new empty level named "level_transition"
   - Created "UE" folder for template files
     > Contains "Third Person Template" subfolder
     > Moved template files here
     > Holds starter content
   - Created "MP" folder for marketplace content

* Asset Management
 * Downloaded "Stylized Egypt" from marketplace
   - Duplicated level to "stylized_Egypt_Corsera"
   - Set as editor startup map
 * Proper File Moving Process
   - Move files to desired location
   - Right click Content folder
   - Select "Fix up redirectors"

* Final Configuration

This setup creates an organized project structure with proper asset management and configurations. The project uses a stylized Egyptian environment instead of basic gray boxes for testing.
