# Procedural & Motion Capture Animation Types

* Procedural Animation
 - Uses real-time systems
   * Physics simulations
   * Code
   * Engine systems
   - "No animation sequence/asset needed"
 - Technical components
   * Math & curves feed into body IK solver
   * Code finds forward position via trace
   * Bones/joints affected by leg movement
   * Rule setting possible
     > Example: "Don't allow two feet in air"
   * Physics for wings/tail/tongue
     > Dangle/bounce with body
   * Can set points of interest
     > Auto-adjusts bone positions
 - Uses Control Rig in UE
   * Handles skeleton/rigging

* Motion Capture
 - Creates animation from real movement
 - Hardware needed
   * Body tracking suits
   * Hand tracking gloves
   * Motion tracking cameras
     > Body movement
     > Facial expressions
 - Benefits/Drawbacks
   * "Speeds up animation development"
   * Allows animator polish after
   * "Expensive setup costs"
   * Needs large room
   * May need skilled actors
 - Modern impact
   * "Empowering next generation creators"
   * Enables small teams
   * Example: "Xanadu on YouTube"

Animation technology has evolved to include both code-driven procedural systems and real-world motion capture. These methods, while different in approach, both enable creators to produce high-quality animations efficiently, though each comes with its own technical and practical considerations.
